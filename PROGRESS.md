# Scrapbook Project Summary and Progress

This document outlines the project goals, technology stack, and the progress made so far on the "Scrapbook" web application.

## 1. Project Overview

**Scrapbook** is a simplified web application inspired by the early days of Facebook. The core idea is to create a small, secure, and simple social platform for a closed group of users.

### Core Principles
*   **Simplicity:** The code and implementation are designed to be as straightforward as possible.
*   **Security:** The application is built with security in mind, particularly regarding user data and access control.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React with Vite
*   **Backend:** Firebase
    *   **Authentication:** For user login and session management.
    *   **Firestore:** As the NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, comments, etc.
    *   **Storage:** For hosting user-uploaded images and videos.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom`
*   **State Management:** `react-firebase-hooks` for simplified Firebase state management in React components.

## 3. Core Features

*   **User & Friend Management:**
    *   **Google Authentication:** Users sign in with their Google accounts for simplicity and security.
    *   **Automatic Profile Creation:** User profiles are created automatically from Google account information.
    *   **Friend Requests:** (Planned) Friendships are mutual and require a request and acceptance.
    *   **Admin User Creation:** A command-line script exists for an administrator to create the initial users.
*   **Timeline & Content:**
    *   **Posts:** Users can create text posts with optional images or videos.
    *   **Timeline:** A central feed displaying posts from all users in chronological order.
    *   **Media Support:** Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and videos (MP4, WebM, MOV) with file validation.
    *   **User Profile:** (Planned) A dedicated page to view a single friend's posts.
    *   **Comments & Reactions:** (Planned) Users can comment and add emoji reactions to posts and comments.

## 4. Progress Summary (Updated August 2025)

**ðŸŸ¢ FULLY FUNCTIONAL**: The app is a complete private social platform. Users can:
- Sign in with Google accounts
- Create text posts with optional media attachments
- Upload images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP up to 10MB)
- Upload videos (MP4, WebM, MOV up to 50MB)
- Edit their own posts with inline editing interface
- Delete their own posts with confirmation and complete cleanup
- **Add friends by email** (works even if they haven't joined yet)
- **Manage friend requests** - send, receive, accept, decline, cancel
- **View private timeline** with posts only from themselves and friends
- **Remove friendships** and manage their friends list
- **Comment on friend posts** with real-time updates
- **Delete their own comments** with confirmation dialog
- **React with emojis** to posts and comments (24 options)
- **Remove their own reactions** by clicking them again
- See edit history with "edited" timestamps
- See upload progress and file previews
- Navigate between authenticated pages
- Sign out properly

**ðŸŸ¡ MINOR CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Using permissive Firestore rules (allow all authenticated users for debugging)
- Storage rules allow all authenticated users (appropriate for closed group)
- Friend system complete - timeline now properly filtered by friendships
