# Scrapbook Project Summary and Progress

This document outlines the project goals, technology stack, and the progress made so far on the "Scrapbook" web application.

## 1. Project Overview

**Scrapbook** is a simplified web application inspired by the early days of Facebook. The core idea is to create a small, secure, and simple social platform for a closed group of users.

### Core Principles
*   **Simplicity:** The code and implementation are designed to be as straightforward as possible.
*   **Security:** The application is built with security in mind, particularly regarding user data and access control.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React with Vite
*   **Backend:** Firebase
    *   **Authentication:** For user login and session management.
    *   **Firestore:** As the NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, comments, etc.
    *   **Storage:** For hosting user-uploaded images and videos.
*   **Routing:** `react-router-dom`
*   **State Management:** `react-firebase-hooks` for simplified Firebase state management in React components.

## 3. Core Features

*   **User & Friend Management:**
    *   **Google Authentication:** Users sign in with their Google accounts for simplicity and security.
    *   **Automatic Profile Creation:** User profiles are created automatically from Google account information.
    *   **Friend Requests:** (Planned) Friendships are mutual and require a request and acceptance.
    *   **Admin User Creation:** A command-line script exists for an administrator to create the initial users.
*   **Timeline & Content:**
    *   **Posts:** Users can create text posts with optional images or videos.
    *   **Timeline:** A central feed displaying posts from all users in chronological order.
    *   **Media Support:** Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and videos (MP4, WebM, MOV) with file validation.
    *   **User Profile:** (Planned) A dedicated page to view a single friend's posts.
    *   **Comments & Reactions:** (Planned) Users can comment and add emoji reactions to posts and comments.

## 4. Progress Summary (Updated August 2025)

### âœ… 1. Project Setup & Configuration
*   Initialized a React + Vite project.
*   Installed core npm dependencies: `firebase`, `react-router-dom`, and `react-firebase-hooks`.
*   Created the Firebase configuration file (`src/firebase.js`).
*   Defined security rules for Firestore (`firestore.rules`) and Storage (`storage.rules`).
*   Created `firebase.json` with hosting, firestore, and storage configuration.
*   Cleaned up default Vite CSS conflicts and established proper styling structure.

### âœ… 2. Admin User Creation
*   Set up a dedicated `admin-scripts` directory.
*   Created a Node.js script (`create-user.js`) using the `firebase-admin` SDK to allow an administrator to create new users from the command line.
*   Added a separate `package.json` for the admin script's dependencies.

### âœ… 3. Google Authentication Implementation
*   **Replaced email/password** authentication with Google OAuth 2.0
*   **Login Component**: Implemented Google sign-in with `signInWithPopup`
*   **Automatic Redirect**: Users are redirected to home page after successful authentication
*   **Profile Integration**: Uses Google account data (name, email, profile photo)
*   **Error Handling**: Proper error display and loading states

### âœ… 4. User Interface & Experience
*   **Header Component**: Shows user info, profile photo, and logout functionality
*   **Home Component**: Displays welcome message and user profile preview
*   **Responsive Design**: Clean, Facebook-inspired UI with proper styling
*   **Protected Routes**: `PrivateRoute` component ensures authentication
*   **Navigation**: Proper React Router integration with redirects

### âœ… 5. Firebase Integration & Deployment
*   **Firebase CLI Setup**: Configured project connection and authentication
*   **Firestore Rules**: Deployed security rules (currently permissive for debugging)
*   **Firebase Hosting**: Successfully deployed to https://crapbook-42b77.web.app
*   **Production Build**: Optimized Vite build with proper routing configuration

### âœ… 6. Posts & Media System
*   **PostCreator Component**: Form for creating posts with text, images, and videos
*   **File Upload System**: Firebase Storage integration with progress tracking
*   **Media Validation**: File type and size validation (10MB images, 50MB videos)
*   **Post Display**: Individual post components with media rendering
*   **Real-time Timeline**: Live feed using Firestore listeners with chronological ordering
*   **Storage Organization**: Structured file storage (`posts/{userId}/{postId}/{filename}`)

### âœ… 7. Code Quality & Structure
*   **CSS Organization**: Separated base styles (`index.css`) from app styles (`App.css`)
*   **Component Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns between components
*   **Error Handling**: Proper authentication error handling and user feedback
*   **Loading States**: Appropriate loading indicators throughout the app
*   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly post creation and timeline display

## 5. Current Status

**ðŸŸ¢ FULLY FUNCTIONAL**: The app is a complete social posting platform. Users can:
- Sign in with Google accounts
- Create text posts with optional media attachments
- Upload images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP up to 10MB)
- Upload videos (MP4, WebM, MOV up to 50MB)
- View real-time timeline with posts from all users
- See upload progress and file previews
- Navigate between authenticated pages
- Sign out properly

**ðŸŸ¡ MINOR CONSIDERATIONS**:
- Using permissive Firestore rules (allow all authenticated users)
- Storage rules allow all authenticated users (appropriate for closed group)
- Timeline shows posts from all users (no friend system yet)

## 6. Next Steps

### Short Term (Social Features)
*   **User Profile Storage**: Save user profiles to Firestore on first login
*   **Friend System**: Implement friend requests and management
*   **Private Timeline**: Show posts only from user and their friends
*   **User Profiles**: Dedicated profile pages for each user

### Medium Term (Enhanced Features)
*   **Comments & Reactions**: Add commenting and emoji reactions to posts
*   **Post Privacy**: Allow users to set post visibility (public/friends only)
*   **Search & Discovery**: Find and add friends by name or email
*   **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for friend requests and interactions

### Long Term (Advanced Features)
*   **Image Editing**: Basic image filters and cropping tools
*   **Video Processing**: Video compression and thumbnail generation
*   **Admin Panel**: User management and content moderation tools
*   **Analytics**: Usage statistics and engagement metrics

## 7. Technical Achievements
